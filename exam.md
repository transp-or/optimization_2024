  in line with EPFL guidelines.
- The exam will be entirely in English and will constitute 100% of your final mark.
- Questions will encompass topics covered in the course and exercises.

   2. An open-book computer-based exam.
   
# Eligibility
Only students adhering to the current EPFL guidelines are eligible to sit for the exam.

# Preparation Material

For the closed book part of the exam, students are permitted a summary
of up to four handwritten pages (equivalent to 8 A4 sides).  While
there's no restriction on the content of the summary, it must be
handwritten. Abstracts not handwritten are inadmissible and will be
removed.  Note: Creating an abstract on an iPad and then printing it
is acceptable, provided it is handwritten.
Each abstract should clearly display the date and the student's name.

For the open-book part of the exam, any material is allowed. 

# Prohibited Items
The use of electronic devices,
including calculators, smartphones, and computers, is strictly
forbidden during the closed-book exam.

# Multiple Choice Questions (MCQ) Scoring
For multiple-choice questions with n possibilities of which one is correct, the number of points is equal to 
- 1 if the answer is correct, 
- 0 if no answer is given, 
- 0 if more than one answer is given, 
- -1 / (n-1) if the answer given is incorrect.

# Grading
The total score (100%) will be transformed to a score out of 6 using the following criteria:
